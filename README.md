# Lerpz
The classic Unity 3d Lerpz tutorial project, from Unity 4.2.1.

Upgraded all the way to 2019.3.8f1 by soraryu.
(using Unity's JS-to-CSharp Converter and Legacy Particle System Upgrader).

Still using Animation instead of Animator / Mecanim.
Still using Legacy Materials ... who's gonna do an HDRP port? :)
